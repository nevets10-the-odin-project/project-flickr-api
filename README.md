# Project: ~Flickr~ Giphy API

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flickr-api

## Introduction

Remember the warm-up in the previous project when you played with the Flickr API? Now it’s time for you to actually use it. Huzzah! You’ll create a basic photo widget that allows you to display photos from your Flickr feed (or someone else’s). We’ll rely on a tutorial for much of the heavy lifting but the principles of what you do here will be repeatable for use with other APIs.

Note: The project page says to use Flickr, but they have since moved to a paid API only model, so I'm using Giphy instead.

## Post-project Review

I ended up doing my own thing since Flickr requires a pro account to access their API. The Giphy API is used in one of the JavaScript path lessons, so I decided to basically set up the same thing in Rails.# project-flickr-api
